Individual tests are run by going into the job directory and running 
`cargo kani --harness <test_name>`

Interesting Notes:
1. Kani will try and unroll as many time as possible even if there is an assumption that bounds the loop. An example of this is the below code:
```Rust
let x : usize = verifier::any!();
verifier::assume!(x < 8);
for i in 0..x {
	// do something
}
```
2. 



`add`: 
- Success

`borsh`:
- This job currently fails seahorn due to the `bcmp()` function not working when testing string compares. When testing with Kani, it gets hung up trying to unwind loops.

`borsh-enums`:
- `test_enums()`: Kani returns success

`borsh-options`:
- `test_option()`: 
	- Seahorn is able to return `unsat` for this job without bounding loops. However, Kani gets stuck in some loop unrolling in the container code for `unwrap()` function. When a bound of 10 is set for loop unrolling, Kani produces success for some tests. However, before exiting the job, it tries to unroll recursion and gets stuck there since the number of iterations cannot be bounded:
```
Unwinding recursion std::ptr::drop_in_place::<std::io::Error> iteration 104
Unwinding recursion std::ptr::drop_in_place::<std::io::error::repr_bitpacked::Repr> iteration 104
Unwinding recursion <std::io::error::repr_bitpacked::Repr as std::ops::Drop>::drop iteration 104

```

`borsh-primitives`:
- `test_primitives()`:
	- Kani returns success

`borsh-structs`:
- `test_structs()`:
	- Kani returns success
- `test_fields()`:
	- Kani returns success

`copy_stack_buffer`:
- Kani returns success

`custom-print`:
- Kani returns success

`custom-print-no-std`:
- Seahorn returns unsat for this job. `cargo build` also builds the static library successful, but I could not port the code successfully into its own `main.rs` environment so that the code can run. Kani ran into compiler errors where macro names are ambiguous:
```
error[E0659]: `print` is ambiguous
 --> src/rust-jobs/custom-print-no-std/lib.rs:9:5
  |
9 |     print!("test");
  |     ^^^^^ ambiguous name
  |
  = note: ambiguous because of a conflict between a macro-expanded name and a less macro-expanded name from outer scope during import or macro resolution
  = note: `print` could refer to a macro from prelude
note: `print` could also refer to the macro defined here
```

`custom-print-writer`:
- Kani returns success

`custom-vec`:
- `test_new()`:
	- Kani returns success
- `test_realloc()`:
	- Kani returns success
- `test_grow()`:
	- Seahorn returns unsat. However, Kani returns with some errors (below). These errors are valid errors.
	- First error: since there is no message, this particular error is hard to debug. I am unsure what the error is.
	- Second error: the custom vector provided does not have a way to bulk initialize memory. Hence, some work around was used (namely manually setting the size of the memory block even though that is not the size of memory allocated). This causes the error in `rust_dealloc` since memory size does not match its layout.
	- Third error: I presume this is again called by the mismatch between initialized memory and the size that it tries to dealloc.
```

- `test_pop()`:
	- Kani returns a similar error as `test_grow()`
- `test_push()`:
	- Kani returns a similar error as `test_grow()`
- `test_drop()`:
	- Kani only returns an error on mismatch in size when trying to dealloc.
- `test_deref()`:
	- Kani tries to loop unwind during `pop()`.  A manual upper bound of the number of pops (10) is set. However, Kani complains about an unwinding assertion (which can be disabled using the `--unwinding-assertions` flag). Again, it also errors on the mismatch in size.
- `test_deref_mut()`:
	- Kani returns success
- `test_insert()`:
	- Kani again gets stuck trying to unwind the for loop that pushes elements. By limiting the number of elements pushed (effectively setting a bound on the for loop unwind), Kani returns only an error on mismatch in size in dealloc.
- `test_remove()`:
	- Kani again gets stuck trying to unwind loops. Once loop is bounded, the only error Kani returns is the size mismatch in dealloc. Another thing to note is Kani caught an index out of bounds error where as Seahorn did not (code below). This occurs at `index == n`. However, this case is handled by `remove()`, with the second code below, so it should have gone into an `panic` state. Kani gave an error instead.
```Rust
fn test_remove() {
    let mut v: CustomVec<i32> = CustomVec::new();
    let n: usize = verifier::any!();
    verifier::assume!(n < 10);
    let index: usize = verifier::any!();
    verifier::assume!(index <= n);

    for i in 0..n { v.push(i.try_into().unwrap()); }

    let res: i32 = v.remove(index);
    verifier::vassert!(res == index.try_into().unwrap());
}

pub fn remove(&mut self, index: usize) -> T {
	assert!(index < self.len, "index out of bounds");
	...
}
